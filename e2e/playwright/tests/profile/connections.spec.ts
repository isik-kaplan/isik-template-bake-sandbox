// Drives the real OIDC test IdP (see auth/social-login.spec.ts), through the profile page's own
// "Connect" button rather than the login page's, so this exercises AutoFormButton/ConnectionsList
// specifically. Uses its own dedicated identity (oidc-e2e-user-2, see
// e2e/authentik-blueprints/oidc-test-idp.yaml) rather than social-login.spec.ts's oidc-e2e-user -
// sharing one identity meant whichever spec ran second saw a returning, already-linked login
// instead of a first-ever one, breaking that spec's own assumptions. A retry of this exact spec can
// still hit that state against its own identity though (allauth correctly refuses to link an
// already-linked social identity to a second local account), so this still follows whichever
// outcome actually happens rather than assuming a single one: a refusal comes back as a real
// redirect to this same page with ?error=connected_other&error_process=connect on the URL -
// ConnectionsList doesn't read that param, so the visible outcome is just the row staying
// "Not connected" with no explanation shown.
