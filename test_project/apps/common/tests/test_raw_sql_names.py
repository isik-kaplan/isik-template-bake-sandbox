"""No raw SQL spells a table name - names come from `_meta` through `apps.common.db`.

Source literals rather than rendered SQL, which misses everything outside a trigger. Tables only: a
model move silently changes one, while a wrong column fails loudly, and the short common column names
cannot be told from prose. Migrations keep whatever literal was compiled at the time, and a test may
spell a name where pinning the physical name is the point - listed in EXEMPT with why.
