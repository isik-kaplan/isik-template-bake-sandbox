"""Facts about the stack this project leans on, proven against the real libraries rather than assumed.

Not tests of this project's code: each pins a behavior of Django, allauth, Celery or Postgres that
some piece of this codebase - or an entry in mutation-equivalents.toml - quietly depends on. Proving
one here, once, beats restating it as an assumption in a docstring, and a library upgrade that breaks
it fails here by name instead of somewhere far away.

Add a test here whenever a feature's correctness rests on a library behavior that is not obvious.
A test named by a `verified_by` in mutation-equivalents.toml must make the very call that entry's
reason is about, not a stand-in that happens to look similar.
