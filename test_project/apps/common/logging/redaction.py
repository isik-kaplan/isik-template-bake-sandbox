"""What of a request may be written down, decided by allowing rather than by forbidding.

A blocklist of sensitive names is wrong here and the reason is not taste: it is a guess maintained
by whoever remembers, every new field is logged in full until somebody notices, and the failure is
silent and permanent - a password written to a log yesterday is not un-written by adding its name to
the list today.

So nothing is logged by value unless it is named. A body and a query string are reported by the
*keys* they carried, which answers what shape a call had without ever writing what was in it, and
the values of names in `LOGGABLE` besides. Headers are allowlisted outright: the three highest-value
secrets in a request - `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-CSRFToken` - are headers, so a body-only rule
would miss all three.
