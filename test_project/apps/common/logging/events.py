"""Everything this deployment is allowed to log, and what each one has to carry.

A closed vocabulary. `log()` refuses an event that was not declared here, so adding a log line is a
line in this file somebody reviews rather than a string somebody invents at six in the evening. The
friction is the feature.

A name is a noun and a past-tense verb, dotted: what it happened to, then what happened. It is the
field everything is searched by, so it outlives the module the call sits in - moving the code does
not break a saved query the way a module path would.
