"""Let mutmut mutate decorated functions and classes, instead of skipping them outright.

mutmut skips every `def` carrying a decorator except a bare `@staticmethod`/`@classmethod`, and
every decorated class entirely. In this codebase that is every DRF `@action`, every `@receiver`,
every `@shared_task`, every `@property`, and every `@track_events()` model - a mutmut run over any
of them reports zero mutants and zero survivors, which reads exactly like a file whose tests kill
everything. It is silence, not a clean result.

The reason is codegen rather than intent. A function becomes the original, N mutated copies and a
trampoline that dispatches between them, and each copy is built with `.with_changes(name=...)` only
- so every copy keeps the decorators too. Twelve mutants of a `@shared_task` would register thirteen
tasks; twelve of a `@receiver` would connect thirteen handlers. Emitting the copies undecorated and
leaving the decorators on the trampoline alone - the thing that actually gets called - fixes that:
each decorator still runs exactly once.

Two kinds of decorator have to stay skipped even so. A descriptor (`@property` and the rest of that
protocol) hands its wrapper something that is not a function, so a trampoline cannot sit under it at
all. A memoizer (`@lru_cache` and the like) wraps the dispatch itself, so every mutant after the
first would be answered from the original's cached value and survive regardless of what it changed -
a false kill, worse than no mutant at all.

A decorated *class* is a simpler case: nothing about it is copied - only the methods inside it get
trampolines, each through the same per-function logic above - so recursing into it is always safe.
mutmut fixed exactly this upstream in 3.8.0 (see its own file_mutation.py comment on the change);
this project pins an older release for unrelated reasons (see pyproject.toml), so it is reproduced
here to get the same behavior either way.

Mutations *inside* a decorator's own arguments are dropped regardless of any of this: a decorator-
stripped copy has nothing left for one to apply to, and mutmut would silently emit a twin of the
original that no test could ever kill.

Installed by every script that asks mutmut to generate mutants (mutation_run.py, mutation_queue.py)
before it does - mutmut has no plugin hook for this, `[tool.mutmut]` in pyproject.toml only reaches
the pytest side of a run, not mutant generation itself.
