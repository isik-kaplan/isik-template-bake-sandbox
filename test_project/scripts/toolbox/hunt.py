"""Find the survivors of ONE source file against the tests you name, in parallel and isolated.

A full run pays for the whole-suite stats pass before testing anything. For one file whose own tests
are fast this skips it: write the mutated file once, then select each mutant by `MUTANT_UNDER_TEST`,
so the file never changes between mutants and they can all run at once.

Every hunt works in a private copy of the project, so the real tree is never written to: a killed
hunt leaves no mutated source behind, and hunts can run beside each other and beside a normal test
run. The virtualenv is linked rather than copied.

Scoped tests make this an *upper* bound on survivors - a mutant another test file kills reads as
surviving here - which is the safe direction: it over-reports work and never hides a survivor.
Survivors a registry already accounts for are listed apart, so they are not re-diagnosed.

    python -m scripts.toolbox.hunt apps/users/adapters.py apps/users/tests/test_adapters.py
    python -m scripts.toolbox.hunt <source.py> <tests...> --only <mutant name>   # settle one mutant
    HUNT_JOBS=6 HUNT_DB_PREFIX=abc MUTMUT_DB_TEMPLATE=... python -m scripts.toolbox.hunt ...

`MUTMUT_DB_TEMPLATE` (from `python scripts/mutation_template.py build`/`name`) makes each session
clone a database rather than migrate one; without it every mutant pays for migrations.
