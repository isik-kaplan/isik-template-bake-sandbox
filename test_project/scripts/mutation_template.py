"""Build the template database mutation runs clone, and prove a clone is faithful to it.

Almost all of a mutant's cost is building a test database - migrating one from scratch every time a
clone of an already-migrated one would do. A clone is fresh *and* cheap, and has to stay fresh: the
shared fixtures commit on purpose, so reusing one database across sessions accumulates state nothing
heals, which cloning avoids by handing each session its own copy.

The template is built by running one database-touching test rather than `migrate` directly, so it is
built the same way pytest-django builds any other test database - through `django_db_modify_db_settings`
in conftest.py, which is also what points a mutation run's own sessions at a clone of it.

    python scripts/mutation_template.py build
    python scripts/mutation_template.py check     # a clone against a freshly migrated database
    python scripts/mutation_template.py drop

`check` is not ceremony: a drifted template measures every mutant against the wrong schema, and the
failure mode of this whole subsystem is a confident green.
