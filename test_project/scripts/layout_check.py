"""One of a thing per file, a folder once there is more than one, and nothing else in there.

Two halves of one standing rule, and a file has to pass both:

1. **A module becomes a folder when it holds more than one of the thing its name declares.**
   `serializers.py` with two serializers is `serializers/` with a file each; `views.py` with one
   view is already right.
2. **A file holds only what its name declares.** A helper does not become a serializer by sitting in
   a file full of them - it belongs on the model, on a queryset, or in a utility module of its own.

A class counts as its file's kind by its own name, by a base it is written against, or by being
named for the file holding it - so `IsOwner(BasePermission)` is a permission, and `history.py` may
hold `HistoryMixin`. A function counts when it is the factory the file is named for. Everything else
in a governed file is a stranger.

A kind is recognised by the name of the module or of the folder it sits in, and its members by the
word their class names carry - `Serializer`, `ViewSet`, `Filter` and so on. That is what keeps the
check honest about what looks like several classes and is one concept: a model with its queryset and
its manager trips nothing, because only one of the three is a model.

`apps/common` is the project's utility package, so a file there may hold a mixin or helpers under a
name that declares something else - it is exempt from the second half and only the second.

A deliberate exception goes in EXCEPTIONS below with the reason it is one. An exception that no longer
excuses anything fails the check too, so the list cannot outlive what it was written for.

Standard library only: the pre-commit hook runs this straight off the checkout, with no container.
