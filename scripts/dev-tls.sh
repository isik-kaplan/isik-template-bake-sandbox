# Local-only https for the plain-http dev stack, so browser APIs that exist only in a secure context
# (WebAuthn/passkeys, service workers, parts of the clipboard API) work on a laptop. It writes a
# certificate and a `listen 443 ssl` snippet into the server's dev-tls/ directory, which both nginx
# server blocks include - empty (the default, and every real deployment) keeps nginx on :80 only.
#
# mkcert when it is installed, because its CA is already in the system and browser trust stores and
# there is no warning to click through. Self-signed otherwise, which still makes the origin secure
# once the warning is accepted - except for WebAuthn, which Chromium refuses on any certificate
# error. `brew install mkcert && mkcert -install` (or your OS's package), then rerun this.
